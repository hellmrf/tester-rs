# Tester-rs

Rust re-implementation of [Testador MC102](https://github.com/TDuarte02/Testador-MC102), used for the testing of programs written by MC102 students at Unicamp.

This is my very first program written in Rust, and its only goal is to be valuable for my own learning, although it can be useful for some other ends. If you intend to *use* this, you're strongly advised to use the [original version](https://github.com/TDuarte02/Testador-MC102), written in Python.
